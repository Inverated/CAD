# TODOs for this repo

- add targets/artifacts for stability: how to calculate characterize the stability?
  is this needed?

- the foam cone of the ama has the wrong length: it overlaps in space with the pvc cone

- render the water line at equilibrium, see buoyancy analysis

- add total ama/vaka volume, and percentage of submersion to buoyancy analysis.
