# TODOs for this repo

- validate-static: remove the weak angle scenario. Add other load
  scenarios: boat suspended at 4 points: ends of outer akas, maybe
  for crane lifting over barrages and locks.

- renderings are often ambiguous regarding whether the sails are convex or concave
  from the point of view of the camera
