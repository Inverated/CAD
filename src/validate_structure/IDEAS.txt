IDEAS FOR ADDITIONAL STATIC VALIDATION TESTS
=============================================

PROPOSED ADDITIONAL TESTS
-------------------------

AKA TESTS:

4. aka_torsion
   Twisting of aka due to asymmetric pillar attachment or wave-induced roll.
   Model: Torsional stress in aka from moment applied at pillar connection.
   Relevant if pillar is offset from aka centerline.


SPINE TESTS:

5. spine_center_load
   Heavy load placed at center of spine (e.g., cargo, water tank, battery bank).
   Model: Spine as beam supported at aka positions, point load at center.
   Load: Design payload at center of crossdeck.

6. spine_torsion
   Twisting of spine when one aka is loaded more than the other (asymmetric wave).
   Model: Torque on spine from differential aka loading.
   Could happen when wave lifts one end of ama but not the other.

7. spine_with_mast_load
   Spine bending from mast compression and stay tensions.
   Model: Add mast foot reaction and shroud attachment loads to spine.
   Important for sailing conditions.


AMA TESTS:

9. ama_bending_between_pillars
   Ama bending as a beam supported at pillar positions.
   Model: Ama as continuous beam, loaded by buoyancy or wave forces.
   Check stress at pillar attachment points.

10. ama_end_impact
    Impact on ama cone/tip from debris or wave slam.
    Model: Point load at ama tip, beam supported at nearest pillar.
    Conservative case for tip damage assessment.


PILLAR TESTS:

11. pillar_compression
    Pillars in compression when ama provides buoyancy (normal sailing).
    Model: Column buckling check for pillar under compressive load.
    Load: Buoyancy force from ama distributed to pillars.

12. pillar_tension
    Pillars in tension when ama is lifted (wave or heeling).
    Model: Tension in pillar connection to aka and ama.
    Check connection strength, not just pillar member.


COMBINED/SYSTEM TESTS:

13. heeling_moment
    Entire structure under sailing heel - ama deeply immersed or flying.
    Model: Asymmetric loading on entire frame from righting moment.
    Combines aka bending, spine torsion, and pillar loads.

14. lifting_sling
    Loads when boat is lifted by crane for launch/haul-out.
    Model: Two-point lift at designated lift points.
    Check local stress at lift points and global bending.

15. transport_support
    Loads when boat is supported on trailer at discrete points.
    Model: Reactions at trailer bunks, frame as continuous structure.
    Identifies problematic support configurations.

16. diagonal_wave
    Wave hitting ama at an angle, creating combined bending and torsion.
    Model: Distributed load on ama at angle to longitudinal axis.
    More realistic than pure transverse or longitudinal loads.


FATIGUE CONSIDERATIONS:

17. fatigue_cycles
    Not a single load case, but estimate of stress cycles over lifetime.
    Model: Identify critical stress ranges and expected cycle counts.
    Use S-N curves for aluminum to estimate fatigue life.
    Focus on welded connections (lower fatigue strength).


PRIORITIES:

High priority (likely governing cases):
- pillar_compression (buckling is sudden failure)
- ama_wave_slam (dynamic loads can exceed static by 2-3x)
- heeling_moment (normal sailing condition)

Medium priority (worth checking):
- spine_center_load (common loading)
- aka_point_load (safety during boarding)
- lifting_sling (if crane launch is planned)

Lower priority (less critical or redundant):
- ama_bending_between_pillars (likely fine if other tests pass)
- transport_support (one-time event, can be controlled)


NOTES:

- All tests should use the same safety factor (2.0) for consistency
- Dynamic loads should use appropriate amplification factors
- Consider both yield strength and deflection limits
- Buckling checks need different approach than bending stress checks
- Connection/weld strength often governs over member strength
