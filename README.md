# Roti Proa CAD model

## Features

The CAD model is entirely programmed in Python.
All components need to be specified in software, in `src`. Features include:
- Main macro: The boat is generated by the macro `src/RotiProa2.FCMacro` which also generates statistics and a view
- Parameters: The boat is fully parameterized; the file `parameters.py` lets you choose the numbers of solar panels and the size of all components
- Mirroring: Roti Proa has a transversal symmetry axis. Most components are described in file `mirror.py` and automatically mirrored in the main
