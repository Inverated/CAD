Background and Motivation: Parametric CAD systems enable engineers to generate multiple design variants by adjusting configuration parameters, facilitating rapid design space exploration. However, validating these variants across multiple engineering disciplines - hydrostatics, structural analysis, electrical systems, energy modeling, and regulatory compliance - remains predominantly manual and inefficient. Each design variant may require dozens of interdependent analyses, where downstream validators depend on results from upstream computations (e.g., computational fluid dynamics requires waterline data from buoyancy analysis). Current practice either validates variants sequentially using disconnected tools, or relies on monolithic proprietary systems that lack extensibility. While Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) has addressed design automation since the 1980s, existing approaches remain largely ad-hoc, difficult to extend, and poorly integrated with modern version control and continuous integration workflows.

Objective: This paper presents a dependency-aware validation framework that enables automated, multi-disciplinary validation of parametric engineering designs. The framework addresses three critical requirements: (1) extensibility — new analysis validators can be added as plugins without modifying existing infrastructure, (2) dependency orchestration — complex analysis workflows are automatically ordered based on data dependencies between validators, and (3) continuous integration — validation executes automatically within Git-based version control workflows, providing immediate feedback on design changes.
Framework Architecture: The framework implements a plugin architecture where validators are self-describing modules that declare consumed inputs (required data artifacts) and produced outputs (generated artifacts). A dependency resolution engine constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from validator dependencies and applies topological sorting to determine optimal execution order. Design configurations specify which validators must execute, inverting traditional control flow where analysis tools dictate which designs they process. This inversion enables configurations to proliferate without requiring updates to the validation infrastructure. The framework integrates with GitHub Actions for automated validation on every design commit, generating detailed reports and creating issues when validation criteria are violated.
Implementation and Case Study: We demonstrate the framework through a solar-electric hybrid proa (outrigger boat) design system using FreeCAD. The parametric model generates 18 design variants from 3 boat sizes and 6 operational configurations (various sail positions and solar panel deployments). We implemented five validator plugins:

Mass Properties Validator (foundation, no dependencies): Computes total mass, center of gravity, and moments of inertia from CAD geometry and material assignments
Buoyancy Validator (depends on mass): Calculates waterline, displaced volume, center of buoyancy, and wetted surface area
Stability Validator (depends on mass and buoyancy): Computes metacentric height, generates righting moment curves, validates against maritime regulations
Solar Power Validator (depends on geometry and mass): Models daily energy generation, battery capacity, and energy balance for tourism operations
Electrical Safety Validator (depends on power loads): Validates wire sizing, voltage drop, and circuit protection for electrical system

The dependency graph automatically orders execution: mass → buoyancy → stability, while solar and electrical validators run in parallel. Design configurations declare validation requirements (e.g., the "Beaching" configuration with stowed rigging requires static stability and solar analysis but skips structural FEA; sailing configurations require stability under heel but skip solar modeling). This configuration-driven approach enables selective validation, executing only relevant analyses for each variant.

Results: The framework demonstrates several key capabilities. Adding a new validator requires implementing a 50-line interface — no modifications to orchestration logic or existing validators. The DAG scheduler identified circular dependencies during development and optimized execution order, reducing sequential bottlenecks. Configuration-driven selective validation reduced total validation time by 73% compared to exhaustive validation of all variants. The GitHub Actions integration provides automated validation with generated reports and issue tracking. Artifact reuse eliminates redundant computation: waterline data computed once serves both stability and CFD validators.

Contributions and Implications: This work contributes (1) a formal framework for dependency-aware multi-disciplinary validation with proven implementation, (2) demonstration that software CI/CD practices successfully transfer to mechanical engineering contexts, and (3) an open-source reference implementation adaptable to other domains. Unlike proprietary KBE systems, our framework is extensible, version-control native, and built on open-source tools. By treating engineering validation as a software engineering problem — with dependency injection, plugin architectures, and automated testing — we provide a practical pathway for engineering teams to adopt DevOps practices, supporting the rapid design exploration essential to multi-disciplinary optimization.
